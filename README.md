# Eye Cancer Patient Prediction Project

This project uses a machine learning pipeline to analyze and predict outcomes for eye cancer patients based on clinical, demographic, and genetic data.

## Project Highlights

- Performed binary classification to predict whether a patient is deceased or alive.
- Evaluated models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble methods.
- Used SMOTE to address class imbalance.
- Feature importance was recalculated after including survival time.
